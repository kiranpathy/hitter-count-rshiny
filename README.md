# hitter-count-rshiny
This project utilizes R Shiny to be able to view by-count and by-pitch data for hitters, which also includes heatmaps to identify hitter trends in pitches seen during selected counts and across selected pitches. Further, this includes plots and data tables that organize batter whiffs and chases for the selected counts and pitch types, which helps understand specific by-count and by-pitch areas for improvement. Given the data, this RShiny app also can cover various dates of games, from every game a batter appears in to just one specific one, and any amount and combination in between. This can be valuable to understand batter approaches by-count and by-pitch as well as understanding how pitchers aim to attack certain hitters. Of note, this app does not have associated data provided, though it can be adapted to fit other publically-available baseball data sets.
